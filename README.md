## General info 
As a fan of Dark Souls I have decided to do something along those lines.
Everyone knows how it's working. It's simply "memory" game. 
Your task is to match cards with the same pictures. 

## Demo movie

## Get started 
1. Download files manualy or via "git clone <link>".
2. Run your IDE with Node.js.
3. Install required node modules (npm install).
4. Run app (npm start)
5. Enter in your explorer "http://localhost:3000/".
6. Train your memory and match all cards!
